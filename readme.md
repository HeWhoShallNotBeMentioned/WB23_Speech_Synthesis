## Description

_{App voices text in text box using the browser built in SpeechSynthesisUtterance.

  There are a variety of accents to chose from. I have chosen only the English ones as non-English ones are still in English but with a broken accent. I deemed this inappropriate.

  There are also sliders for rate (i.e. speed) and pitch of the playback which can be set independently. Stop and start button are located at the bottom.

  And change to an option (other than Stop) will start the playback over from the beginning. }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_{Download the files, open index.html, and begin customizing the output you would like.}_

## Known Bugs

_{ As stated in the description, the default voices are all native english speakers. You can give the user all of the available options by uncommented out the filter in the function populateVoices. }_
